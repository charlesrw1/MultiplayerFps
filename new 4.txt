draw scene (color and depth) to scene fbo
make ssao texture
	-input (scene color and depth, noise texture)
	-output (color ssao texture)
combine scene color and ssao texture to make output color texture
	also add fog here

then use output color and original scene depth:
	draw transparents, sprites, debug graphics, ui, etc.

textures needed:
	scene_color
	scene_depth
	ssao_color
	output_color
	
	scene_fbo (sc, sd)
	ssao_fbo (ssaot)
	final_fbo (ot, sd)
