shooting mechanics
	-when player presses fire the following happens
		-local client side effects (gun animation, firing sound)
		-server rolls back entities to the players perspective (their tick - cl interp) does a raycast and determines if anything is hit. If a player is hit, decrease their health. If their health is at 0, call a respawn routine in the multiplayer game rules. Also when other players fire, send sound/particle event to other clients to play. Also need team system for friendly fire and such
	
	-for the bomb item, a flag is kept server side if player is in bomb zone, if they are, then animation starts
	
basic grenade physics (10/5)	

win/lose states
	-multiplayer game rules handles the round timers
triggers for buy zone and bomb planting
game states for menu/in game/ etc
particle effects/trails: server sends them over and can have optional owner entity to grab pos from

tech updates:
delta snapshot encoding (mostly done 10/4)
reliable messages (not very difficult now) 
entity interpolation on clients with pos history (done 10/4)
lag compensation on server
(Maybe): buffer inputs on server to avoid simming 2 inputs in one packet
update physics to detect collisions between objs and response (started 10/5)

gfx:
textured models (easy) (done 10/10)
ui rendering, font loading

todo:
ui, fonts, etc.
server and client side shooting
lag compensation
reliable messages
particles
shadows for players
sounds
viewmodel animations (can be procedural)
view recoil
bomb zone trigger
